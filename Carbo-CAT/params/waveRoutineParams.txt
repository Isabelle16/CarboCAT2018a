1            wind direction vector y component
0              wind direction vector x component  
+y             wind direction (+- y/+-x)
18             wind velocity in m/s  
8              wave period in deep water sec [3s - 20s]          
70            water depth in meters below which the wave energy is zero
0.002         dump (larger = wave energy decrease more steeply with depth)
20          fetch length outside model boundary (will be then multiplied by dx to have the area)     was 1
2           reef extent (number of model cell that we consider high energy after the wave brake -i.e. wave energy dissipation-)
